    <h2>io capitano</h2>
    <p>march 10, 2024 @ 9:49</p>
	<p>cinema these days seems preoccupied with style over substance, but io capitano is different. rather than massive set-pieces and flashy scenes it offers a poignant look at the strength and resilience inherent to the human soul. against the backdrop of migration the film follows the story of seydou and moussa, two cousins from senegal, as they embark on a risky journey to italy, traversing the difficult terrains of mali, niger, and libya.</p>
	<p>it goes beyond the topic of migration to dive deep into themes of hope, unity, and survival. the relationship between seydou and moussa is utterly captivating, providing a glimpse into their combined hopes and all of the uncertainties they face together.</p>
	<p>the film doesn't shy away from the myriad of challenges of their journey, yet it also highlights the essence of human compassion. through seydou&rsquo;s character, the film celebrates the incredible capacity for humans to support and uplift each other, even in the most dire circumstances.</p>
	<p>despite the subject matter io capitano resonates as a universal story about human connections, the sacrifices we make, and our quest for a brighter future. it invites us all to reflect on what home means and the lengths to which people will go for a glimpse of hope.</p>
	<p>the film doesn&rsquo;t just document their difficult journey; it reflects the varied experiences of migrants with empathy and compassion. seydou&rsquo;s unwavering resolve and kindness, particularly in the face of tough decisions, lend a profound depth to the narrative.</p>
	<p>io capitano was nominated for the best international feature film at both the golden globes and the oscars, and though it was (in my opinion) snubbed it'll always be a favourite of mine. it stays with you, encouraging deeper thoughts on the complexities of human nature and the silent bonds that connect us. as we follow the journey of seydou and moussa, we are reminded of the indomitable human spirit to dream, to overcome, and to care deeply in a world that can often feel indifferent.</p>
